The new [Grind](https://github.com/AnharHussainMiah/grind/) Java build tool that I've been developing requires a test runner. In a twist of poetic serendipity, what better way to build this test runner than using the very tool itself!

`TestTube` is a small Java CLI to be used by the `grind` Java build tool as the main test runner. `TestTube` leverages the existing JUnit framework API.
